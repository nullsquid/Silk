:: No, but he gave me a job.



:: Start
"What can I get for you, hun?"

"[[Burger and fries. | And coffee.]]"

"[[Egg salad sandwich and onion rings.  And coffee.]]"


:: Burger and fries.  And coffee.
"Sure thing.  You got a long drive ahead of you?"

"[[It'll be a few hours.]]"

"[[No, not long at all.]]"


:: No, not long at all.
"That's good.  Most of the people who come in here, they've been driving for a long while, and they still have a long while to go.  You look like you could use a big cup of coffee."

"[[Thanks.]]"

"[[Just a half a cup. ]]"


:: Thanks.
"Not a problem."  {Patrons at the next table begin to get noisy.  Beatrice lights them on fire.}  "You want another cup, sweetie?"

"[[Yes, please.]]"

"[[No, thanks.]]"


:: No, thanks.
"That's a trick I picked up from a man I met a few years ago.  I think you might know him as well."

"[[I think I do, too.]]"

"[[It's a very impressive trick.]]"


:: I think I do, too.
"Did he teach you any tricks?"

"[[Nothing that cool.]]"

"[[No, but he gave me a job.]]"


:: You're right.



:: New York.
"I never liked New York.  It's a dirty city, don't you think?"

"[[Filthy.]]"

"[[I lo|ve it.]]"


:: With cream.
"That's how I like it.  Where are you coming from?"

"[[New York.]]"

"[[Idaho.]]"


:: Yes, please.
"Coming right up."

"[[So you're a witch?]]"

"[[Thank you.]]"


:: Idaho.
"You know what I just heard?  I heard there was a serial killer who just escaped from jail over there."

"[[I hadn't heard about that.]]"

"[[I'm sure they'll catch him soon.]]"


:: Filthy.

:: Egg salad sandwich and onion rings.  And coffee.
"Coming right up.  How do you take your coffee?"

"[[Light and sweet.]]"

"[[Black.]]"


:: It'll be a few hours.
"I thought so.  I see a lot of people in this diner.  But you've got a certain look about you that I've only seen a few times.  I think you and I might have a friend in common."

"[[Oh?]]"

"[[I don't think so.]]"


:: Just a half a cup.
"Half a cup it is."

"[[With cream.]]"

"[[No sugar.]]"


:: I usually don't have that problem.



:: It's a very impressive trick.
"I'm glad that you think so."

"[[Can you show me how?]]"

"[[I guess I'd better get going soon.]]"


:: No sugar.
"You got it.  You're not very chatty, are you?"

"[[No.]]"

"[[Not really.]]"


:: I already know that, thanks.
"Alright.  I'm just trying to be friendly is all."

"[[It's fine.  I'm just tired.]]"

"[[I'm not a friendly person.]]"


:: Nothing that cool.



:: I think I'll take the check now.



:: I guess I'd better get going soon.

:: Light and sweet.
"That's how I like it, too.  I think you and I have a lot in common."

"[[Like what?]]"

"[[I doubt it.]]"


:: Black.
"You got it, hun.  Gotta stay awake for the long trip.  Where you heading?"

"[[Minnesota.]]"

"[[Rhode Island.]]"


:: I don't think so.
"I get it, you just want to eat and be on your way.  I don't want to stop you, I just want you to know that it might not be as easy as you think."

"[[I already know that, thanks.]]"

"[[Who is this friend you have in mind?]]"


:: I think I know.
"He's been very kind to me over the years.  I think he'll be kind to you, too."

"[[I hope so.]]"

"[[What makes you say that?]]"


:: Not really.
"That's fine.  I don't need to talk to everybody.  You're a truck driver, right?  That's just like being a waitress.  Some people are nice, but most people think you must've done something wrong to wind up with a job like that, and they're not polite to you cause they think they're better than you."

"[[You're right.]]"

"[[I usually don't have that problem.]]"


:: Who is this friend you have in mind?
"To be fair, most people meet him at one time or another.  Sometimes he wears red, and sometimes he wears black, and sometimes he doesn't wear anything at all.  Sound familiar?"

"[[I think I know.]]"

"[[No, go on.]]"


:: No, go on.
"I don't mean to be vague, but he's a hard guy to pin down.  Some people say he's ugly, but I always liked his face.  Everyone agrees that he's very charismatic, though."

"[[I understand.]]"

"[[He does have a nice face.]]"


:: I love it.



:: Like what?
"Some years ago, a gentleman came into this diner.  Nothing out of the ordinary about him.  As a matter of fact, he sat right here at this table."

"[[So?]]"

"[[Did he have a black briefcase?]]"


:: No.
"Did you ever hear, about the woman who came up to Calvin Coolidge at a party and said, 'I made a bet that I could get three words out of you,' and he said to her, 'You lose.'  Did you ever hear that?"

"[[Yeah.]]"

"[[Nope.]]"


:: Can you show me how?



:: I doubt it.
"Alright, then.  Your food will be right out soon."

{Brings out food and it catches on fire as soon as it's set on the table}

"[[What the hell?]]"

"[[Just how I like my egg salad.]]"


:: Rhode Island.
"Oh, I went on vacation there once.  Providence.  Nicest vacation I've ever been on.  Do you like it there?"

"[[It's okay.]]"

"[[I've never been before.]]"


:: Oh?
"Met him a few years ago.  He came in here and sat down at this same table you're sitting at.  Very nice man.  Made me an offer, and I took him up on it."

"[[Do you think it worked out for you?]]"

"[[What was the offer?]]"


:: What was the offer?
"The details aren't important.  The important thing is, he made me promise that in return, I'd keep an eye out for his other associates."

"[[I'm surprised.  He's never struck me as considerate.]]"

"[[Well, it's a dangerous business.]]"


:: It's fine.  I'm just tired.
"I understand.  We all get tired now and then."

"[[That's a truism if I ever heard one.]]"

"[[Indeed.]]"


:: Minnesota.
"Never been there.  You work out up there?"

"[[That's right.]]"

"[[Nope, just visiting.]]"


:: I hadn't heard about that.



:: So?
"He gave me a way to deal with rude customers, such as yourself."  {Egg salad lights on fire.}  "Do you catch my meaning?"

"[[I think I know the gentleman you met.]]"

"[[I don't quite understand.]]"


:: Well, it's a dangerous business.
"That it is, that it is.  You're one of the delivery people, aren't you?  He's been hiring a lot of those lately."

"[[Yep.]]"

"[[How many others?]]"


:: Thank you.
"Can I get you anything else."

"[[Just the check please.]]"

"[[No, that'll be it.]]"


:: Nope.



:: Just how I like my egg salad.
"That's a trick our mutual friend taught me.  Impressive, isn't it?"

"[[Quite.]]"

"[[I've seen better.]]"


:: I'm not a friendly person.
"Apparently.  Can I ask you why?  What's wrong with being friendly?"

"[[It's not my nature.]]"

"[[It doesn't usually work out for me.]]"


:: It's okay.
"Are you gonna drive all the way out there?"

"[[That's the plan.]]"

"[[I have a job to do.]]"


:: Do you think it worked out for you?
"Oh, absolutely.  I haven't regretted it for a moment."

"[[That's comforting to hear.]]"

"[[What'd you have to give him in return?]]"


:: That's right.
"What do you do?"

"[[Delivery person, of sorts.]]"

"[[I'm an artist.]]"


:: I'm surprised.  He's never struck me as considerate.
"Oh, it's not out of consideration for you.  But he'll treat you well, if you do well at your job."

"[[Do you know him very well?]]"

"[[What does he look for in his employees?]]"


:: I'm sure they'll catch him soon.



:: So you're a witch?
"Oh, I don't like that word.  But I have certain tricks that I've picked up here and there.  They're especially useful for rude customers.  Your boss showed me how."

"[[I think you have me confused for someone else.]]"

"[[Oh, you know him?]]"


:: Yeah.



:: Did he have a black briefcase?
"That's right.  Black suitcase and a black hat.  The table right beside him had two boys who were being rude as hell.  I didn't want to complain about it, but the gentleman with the suitcase asked me quietly if I'd like to do anything about it.  I told him I certainly would, but I couldn't.  Then he said, what if I could?  Do you know the man I mean?"

"[[I think I do.]]"

"[[I'd rather not talk about it.]]"


:: What the hell?
"I don't take kindly to rude customers.  Now, like I said, I think we have a friend in common, so I want to give you a word of advice."

"[[Go on.]]"

"[[I don't take kindly to having my food set on fire.]]"


:: I have a job to do.
"I know, hun."

"[[I think I'll take the check now.]]"

"[[What do you know?]]"


:: That's comforting to hear.
"Looking at you, I think you'll be just fine.  You've got what it takes."

"[[Thank you, ma'am.]]"

"[[I really hope so.]]"


:: Nope, just visiting.
"Family?"

"[[A friend.]]"

"[[No, I don't have any family.]]"


:: I've never been before.
"I hope you have a good time.  I have a friend who lives up there though, maybe you know him?"

"[[It's a big place.]]"

"[[What's he look like?]]"


:: What'd you have to give him in return?
"Coffee.  That's all.  Lots of coffee."

"[[How does he take his coffee?]]"

"[[He works in mysterious ways, I guess.]]"


:: I hope so.



:: What makes you say that?



:: That's the plan.
"That's a really long drive.  You want some coffee to go?  I can put it in a travel mug for you."

"[[No, thanks you.]]"

"[[I don't have one, but thanks.]]"


:: I think I do.



:: I think I know the gentleman you met.



:: It's a big place.
"Most people have met him, one way or another.  I think you know who I mean."

"[[No, I don't.]]"

"[[Yes, I do.]]"


:: What's he look like?
"I think he's handsome, but not everyone agrees."

"[[Like Benedict Cumberbatch.]]"

"[[I know who you mean.]]"


:: I've seen better.
"Can't win them all.  I'd like to see you do better, though."

"[[Magic isn't my specialty.]]"

"[[I'm just a courier.]]"


:: I'd rather not talk about it.
"Alright, that's your business.  You want anything else?"

"[[Ketchup?]]"

"[[No, that will be it.]]"


:: Just the check please.



:: I'm an artist.
"Oh, that's nice.  What kind of work do you do?"

"[[Mixed medium.]]"

"[[Sculpture.  Do you want to see one of my pieces?  I have it in the truck.]]"


:: No, that'll be it.



:: Quite.
"You want to show me one of yours?"

"[[I'm not a witch.]]"

"[[If you want to come to my truck, I can show you something cool.]]"


:: I don't quite understand.



:: Go on.
"We have a mutual friend, and he can give you some wonderful things, if he wants.  But he doesn't like it when people fail him."

"[[I already knew that, thanks.]]"

"[[Good to know.]]"


:: That's a truism if I ever heard one.



:: Delivery person, of sorts.
"Do you like it?  Getting to drive all around the country."

"[[It's not the country.  Just this one area.]]"

"[[No, I don't like it.]]"


:: Indeed.



:: A friend.
"Okay.  I think I might happen to know your friend."

"[[A lot of people do.]]"

"[[I sort of doubt it.]]"


:: I don't take kindly to having my food set on fire.
"Alright, then.  You don't have to listen."

"[[Okay.]]"

"[[Can I have another sandwich?]]"


:: No, I don't have any family.
"That's a shame.  I hope you find someone, then."

"[[Me too.]]"

"[[I'm not really a people person anyway.]]"


:: Oh, you know him?



:: I think you have me confused for someone else.



:: He does have a nice face.



:: I understand.



:: Thank you, ma'am.



:: How does he take his coffee?



:: Do you know him very well?



:: How much?
"For you, it's on the house.  As a favor to our mutual friend.  But let me give you something before you head out."  {kisses MC on the cheek}


:: How many others?



:: No, that will be it.



:: No, thanks you.



:: Yep.



:: I already knew that, thanks.



:: Okay.



:: Good to know.



:: Yes, I do.



:: It's not my nature.



:: A lot of people do.



:: I don't have one, but thanks.



:: I really hope so.



:: I'm not really a people person anyway.



:: He works in mysterious ways, I guess.



:: Can I have another sandwich?



:: What does he look for in his employees?



:: It doesn't usually work out for me.



:: Ketchup?



:: I know who you mean.



:: No, I don't.



:: What do you know?



:: Sculpture.  Do you want to see one of my pieces?  I have it in the truck.



:: I sort of doubt it.



:: If you want to come to my truck, I can show you something cool.



:: Like Benedict Cumberbatch.



:: Mixed medium.



:: Me too.



:: No, I don't like it.



:: I'm not a witch.



:: It's not the country.  Just this one area.



:: I'm just a courier.



:: Magic isn't my specialty.
